              Hi, I'm a software engineer based in Austin, TX with experience writing full stack
              applications. I most recently worked at Indeed.com in their internal Incubator. It's a group dedicated
              to new product innovation and each product is treated like a startup.
            </p>
            <p>
              In March 2023, Indeed announced layoffs affecting 15% of their workforce, including me.
              While this was disappointing news, it's reassuring to know it was done to right-size the business
              and not for performance reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the meantime, I'm taking a writing course called Write of Passage. It's a 5 week course that
              teaches writing as a method to improve one's thinking. I hope this sharpens my communication skills
              and helps me connect with others. You can find a link to my Substack above.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm current looking for a role as a tech lead or engineering manager. If you're hiring,&nbsp;
